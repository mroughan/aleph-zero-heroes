# Aleph-Zero-Heros

**This is a blog about (mathematical) data science of large-scale hybrid
narratives and superheros in particular.**

The title of the blog comes from a, perhaps obscure, piece of
mathematics: [aleph zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number) is
(mathematically speaking) the cardinality of the set of natural
numbers, which is a pretty mathsy way of saying "infinity". So the
name, aleph-zero-heros, loosely translates as *infinity*. And the blog
is going to be focused on superhero narratives, hence the title ---
read it as **infinite heros**.

To explain what, why and so on of all this, see below.

## What is that thing you said? {#what}

A hybrid narrative (to me) is a story (fiction or non-fiction) that
involves multiple forms of media. We can get an idea by considering
simple examples of old-school hybrids

 + picture books and graphic novels
 + choose your own adventure books, which combine games with prose

and so on, or the modern mash-ups that the web has made so easy to
augmented reality systems.    
 
People concerned with hybrid media, stories and narratives often focus
on the avante guard, or the outre aspects of the field.  I am
interested in popular culture. I am interested in the hybrid stories
that reach millions of people. So in this blog, we are not just
interested in simple hybrid texts, that is single graphic novels, or
combinations of other forms of media. We are interested in
large-scale, massive hybrids created in response to popular demand. 

For instance, graphic novels have inspired a new genre of movies --
superhero movies -- and these have become massively popular. But where
once these were single, throw-away movies, now they form their own
ecosystems of multiple movies plus different classes of media and
don't forget the vast amounts of fan fiction and commentary. The
Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is the best example of this.

In these ecosystems, novels or graphic novels inspire movies, which in
turn spin off games, and TV series, and traditional novels, and new
graphic novels. The MCU might be the best example, but DC is following
close behind and we can think about the Star Wars or Harry Potter
franchises in the same way. And don't be surprised to see more
following suit. These franchises are worth a *lot* of money. The MCU
movies alone have generated nearly $20 billion. I'm not sure anyone
outside of Marvel knows what the whole franchise is worth. 

They relatively low-cost, "pulp" nature of graphic novels allowed
their authors and artists to do new things.  Then these have folded
back into other forms of story telling, the superhero movie genre
being the most obvious. And it is careless to then write these off as
simple action movies without thinking a little more deeply about how
they mirror our society, and in turn affect it.

I think we are learning something about people from narrative
analysis, though I am not a social scientist or a humanties scholar,
so I don't want to presume too much. I just want to understand some of
the mathematics of stucture of stories.

## Why? {#why}

The capacity that sets humans apart from the animal kingdom is not our
ability to use tools (there are animals, even birds that also use
tools); or our ability to communicate (many animals speak to each
other); or our ability to form complex social bonds (some animals bond
for life). Human's are unique in our
ability and *desire* to tell stories.
 
Myths, legends, narratives, and fictions allow us to build larger
social constructs than
[Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number)
(around 150). Stories are part of how we plan ahead. Stories allow us
to change and adapt as a species more quickly than our the genetic
heritage of most species. Stories have made us the dominant species on
the planet is the blink of an eye (on evolutionary time scales).
 
So if stories are what make us who we are, then they are worth
studying. I'm a mathematician, so that's the aspect of stories that I
am inevitably interested in, though I make no argument that it is the
most important part. However, there is an increasing amount of effort
going into "narrative analysis" both of fiction (e.g., ) and
non-fiction (e.g., distant reading of historical source materials),
and mathematics and computer science are a crucial part of that
analysis. 

Why large-scale hybrid narratives? It's only recently that we have
been able to do these. Logistical, technical and economic constraints
have prevented really large-scale hybrids until recent. It's
interesting to look at what's new and cool. And given these are driven
by demand, they reflect features of our world that are (to me)
interesting. 

We could have chosen to do Harry Potter, so why superheros in
particular? I guess that reflects personal biases, but also superheros
a a big part of modern popular culture and have been for longer than
Harry Potter. I see them as a richer, and more evolved phenomena --
the idea behind superheros isn't really a new thing at all.

Formally, we might trace the idea back to Nietzsche, but the modern
comic superhero really dates from Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in the
30s, right around the time of the invention of the comic book
[(Superman, Action Comics #1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Comics_1). The
two things were synergistic.

They might seem new, but the superhero is just a modernisation of
the hero of any number of myths and legends. Classical mythology is
repleat with heros with special powers. They may not have been
"mutants", but they usually got their powers through goods genes. A
typical hero was usually a descendent of a God (or two).

Many comics books take inspiration directly from mythology (Wonder
Woman, Thor, Thanos, ...). 
Others create an all-new story (radioactive spider bite weren't a
thing until we have radiation) but the stories are still the same.

Even when they arise independently the evolve towards common story
elements.  

+ The hero, goes through a journey, usually some nadir, and then is
  reborn. And he takes what he learns in the journey towards his
  eventual victory -- sounds like Iron Man 1 to me?
+ Too often, the villain is a victim of hubris -- sounds like a mad
  scientist to me.
+ A hero seeks revenge for a murdered father -- maybe Batman is
  Orestes?  Of course, Bruce Waine didn't need to extend his revenge
  to his mother as well. So he was lucky. Really.
  
There are also direct parallels

+ Superman has his Achilles heel. 
+ Achilles warriors were called Myrmidons = Ant-men.
+ Gilgamesh, a demi-god and initially an arrogant king or prince of
  his city state (Thor?) meets a wild-man Enkidu (The Hulk), and
  after fighting each other to a stand still they bond and have
  adventures together. 
+ Deadpool -- a cosmic fool if ever there was.
+ Arthur and his round table = the Justice League?

And Superman was found in a reed basket on the river, or was that Moses?

More important than the parallels in particular characters is the fact
that comics-book heros served many of the same functions as the
characters from legend. They provide a shared cultural experience,
important parts of which are aimed at forming common concepts of
morality by providing super-real role models and assigning to them
dilemas that we can all understand.

And some of the stories are deadly serious. Watchman is Alan Moore's
magnum opus, and a modern *1984*. It's a brilliant story about human
frailty, and the evils of good intentions, and the horror of war, all
wrapped around a satire on caped crusaders.

<!-- A lot of mythology was explanitory -- "where did that earthquake come -->
<!-- from?" and the like. But many more were about the human experience. We -->
<!-- can see that in our language, so much of which evolved from classical -->
<!-- mythological orgins. These days they same thing is happening. Popular -->
<!-- culture coins new terms every day, but who doesn't know "Hulk Smash" -->
<!-- ... -->

I don't know if he ever read comics, but I think
[Joseph Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell) would
have been at home there. He understood the parallels between the hero
myths of different cultures. He would have understood the modern
parallels as well.

Given their connection to cultural norms comics also form a barometer
for our culture. That might be worrying: comics are well-known to have
strong gender and racial biases (though the situation is improving I
think).

Or it might be encouraging: a common theme in many comics is a
(perhaps guarded) optimism about the future.

And in between there are some interesting cultural quirks: there was a
lot more sex in classical mythology than in the mainstream comics and
their associated movies. Modern heros are often chaste, or at least
sex happens behind closed doors.  That is perhaps another reflection
of the mix of new puritanism that is a strong undercurrent of the
modern West, despite equally strong hedonistic tendencies in direct
conflict.

So don't write superheros off as "escapist". And even if
that's what you want to call 'em, then listen to Neil Gaiman:

> ...escapist fiction is just that: fiction that opens a door, shows the sunlight outside, gives you a place to go where you are in control, are with people you want to be with (and books are real places, make no mistake about that); and more importantly, during your escape, books can also give you knowledge about the world and your predicament, give you weapons, give you armour: real things you can take back into your prison. Skills and knowledge and tools you can use to escape for real.
>
> As JRR Tolkien reminded us, the only people who inveigh against escape are jailers.” 
> ― Neil Gaiman, The View from the Cheap Seats: Selected Nonfiction


I don't know enough of this stuff. I don't know enough about
writing. I don't know enough social science, and although I was
brought up with the Greeks and Romans in my house (and the Norse next
door) there are whole swathes of world mythology I know only
peripherally.  If nothing else, this blog is a chance for me to learn
more.

## How {#how}

I work mostly on networks, so that's the type of analysis you will see
a bit of here, but networks touch on everything so there's going to be
bits of math from everywhere. 

If you want to see some examples of what people are doing with
networks, have a look at the following:

+ [Marvel Universe looks almost like a real social network](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0202174)
  in which the authors argue that the network created by linking
  characters who share a comic has many of the characteristics of
  real-life, human social networks. 

+ [How to become a superhero](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/2007/09/P09020/meta)
  is similar, but goes a little further. 

+ [Network analysis of the Íslendinga sögur – the Sagas of Icelanders](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjb/e2013-40583-3)
  in which the authors examine the network of characters in the
  Icelandic sagas, again comparing them to real social networks. 

+ [Universal properties of mythological networks](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1209/0295-5075/99/28002/meta)  
  in which the authors compare the networks of characters in a set of
  mythology texts (*Beowulf*, the *Iliad* and the *Táin Bó
  Cuailnge*. Again they find parallels. 
  
  These authors have a nice
  [visualisation](https://yosej.github.io/Ossian_Full_Network/) of one
  of the networks they are dealing with.

+ And *Game of Thrones* is featured in
  [Network of Thrones](https://networkofthrones.wordpress.com/the-novels/a-game-of-thrones/) 
  and [Another Game of Thrones network analysis ](https://shirinsplayground.netlify.com/2018/03/got_network/) 
  is perhaps the best known example, because of the popularity of
  *Game of Thrones*, but also because 
  [Kaggle released a dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/game-of-thrones).

The finding of universal properties in our narratives is a big part of
what motivates this blog, but network analyses are often focused on
empirical measurements of network features, and I am hoping to go a
little further. 

At the same time there is increasing interest in getting to these
corpora without messing around manually: e.g.,

+ [Automatic Extraction of Social Networks from Literary Text: A Case Study on *Alice in Wonderland*](https://aclanthology.info/papers/I13-1171/i13-1171)

and our own recent effort

+ [The one comparing narrative social network extraction techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01467)

I'm learning [Julia](https://julialang.org/) these days, so I thought
there was an opportunity to use this as a project to learn Julia, so
expect lots of this, though some Python or Perl may creep in at some
point. If you don't know anything about Julia then look it up. It's
cool!

I think its going to take a little while to builf up to the math, so
mostly we'll start with code and data.
