# Aleph-Zero-Heros

**This is a blog about (mathematical) data science of large-scale hybrid
narratives and superheros in particular.**

The title of the blog comes from a, perhaps obscure, piece of
mathematics: [aleph zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number) is
(mathematically speaking) the cardinality of the set of natural
numbers, which is a pretty mathsy way of saying "infinity". So the
name, aleph-zero-heros, loosely translates as *infinity*. And the blog
is going to be focused on superhero narratives, hence the title ---
read it as **infinite heros**.

A hybrid narrative (to me) is a story (fiction or non-fiction) that
involves multiple forms of media. We can get an idea by considering
simple examples of old-school hybrids

 + picture books and graphic novels
 + choose your own adventure books, which combine games with prose

and so on, or the modern mash-ups that the web has made so easy to
augmented reality systems. 

But technology today has allowed artists and writers to build much
larger joint constructs, and that is what I am interested in here.
 
I've gone into much more detail in [this post](/posts/description/).
