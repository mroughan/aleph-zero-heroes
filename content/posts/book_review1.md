# Intro

I thought an occasional book review might not go astray. This is the
first one.

Unlike many book reviewers, I am not particularly interested in
reviewing the latest, greatest books. And I don't plan to review
comics or graphic novels as such. I just plan to review media that I
find for the first time. 

My most recent addition to my library was of
[*Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Comics),
by Scott McCloud. I read it because it was about comics, but that is
not why I am reviewing it. I am reviewing it because it is a deeper
book than even its author knows. I think it is a book about *data
visualisation*. It's the best book on data visualisation.

That might be a challenging statement, but I have read a little on the
topic. I have a couple of Tufte's famous books. I've glanced at Tukey,
and I have *How to Lie with Statistics* by my bedside (that isn't as
ringing en endorsement as you might think -- I have half a thousand
books cluttering up the bedroom). I plan to read more --
recommendations are welcome. But then there is this book that isn't
even, ostensibly, about visualisation.

Why then, would I recommend it? To explain that I want to quickly
summarise the book.
