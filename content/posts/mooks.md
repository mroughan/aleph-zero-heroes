# Intro
 
{{% blockquote author="Hawkeye, from Thor" %}} 
 Do you want me to slow him down, sir, or do you want to send in some more guys for him to beat up?
{{% /blockquote %}}


There's a scene in *The Winter Soldier* that is so cool they reprise
it in *Endgame*: Captain America (Steve Rogers) gets into a glass
elevator followed by Brock Rumlow, and the elevator is loaded up with
as many Hydra agents<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> as you
can fit in one elevator.

There is some dialogue between Brock and Steve, but it's 
inconsequential. More important are the carefully averted stares and
tense stances. 

Then there is a magnificently choreographed fight. Steve is the
star, no doubt. And Brock (later
[Crossbones](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Crossbones))
is the bad guy, but the scene is built around an elevator crowded with
opponents. And though they might be called "stunt men" they are IMHO
serious actors. They might not say much, but their physical acting is
important to the scene. Still, we don't know who they are<sup><a
href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>.

 <!-- https://twitter.com/ChrisEvans/status/987052240132288512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E987052240132288512&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fjunkee.com%2Fcaptain-america-endgame-elevator%2F202771 -->
 
These unnamed characters are important to a movie, and there can be a
long list: "Bigger than Ben Hur" isn't a phrase because Ben was
big. It was because of the epic and extravagant scope of the 1959 film
-- apparently it had over 10,000 extras. But the sheer number of such
characters doesn't really show how important they are -- most of the
extras in Ben Hur are just background.
 
I thought it might be interesting to investigate just how important
these unnamed characters are to the Marvel Cinematic Universe
(MCU). And I think the results tell us something pretty deep about our
societal beliefs about the value of certain roles.
 
 
# Superhero movies are driven by conflict
 
Let's take a step back. Superhero movies are sub-genre of *action*
movies<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>. The audience is there
to see action, not drama, or monologues, or music although these aspects
are  important.

Action is driven by conflict: Man v World, Good v Evil, or Avenger v
Avenger, it's all grist.

So superhero movies are driven by conflict. 

What can we do with that?

One thing that intrigues me is that much of the infrastructure for
talking about parts or roles in movies is not based on action. Movies
still pay tribute to their origins in the theatre, in the same way
that we still use QWERTY keyboards long after the reason for this
confusing layout has gone. 

We see this in how Hollywood allocates credit. Actors' parts are
broken down largely by how much dialogue they speak. Major parts might
be given precedence by other factors (the seniority or fame of the
actors), but as a rule, major roles involve lots of speaking, and less
important roles less. It is sometimes formalised, e.g., by actors'
trade unions, into categories such as

+ a *bit part* is one with no more than 5 lines; and 

+ an *extra* (or *background talent* or *atmosphere* or
*supernumerary* or *junior artist*) is a "silent" role<sup><a
href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>.

Bit parts might be listed in the credits. Extras are often omitted,
but might be noted in sources such as IMDb where the actor was
identifiable. But in an action movie, even the least extra character
may play an important part without saying anything. They can be

+ killed to show how a power, or device, or monster works, 

+ killed to show how evil a bad guy is, 

+ killed (accidentally) by a good guy to create angst,  

+ an acceptable target (to be taken down by an otherwise peace-loving
hero); or 

+ in some cases an "extra" may even be a serious obstacle.

And yet these characters generally remain unnamed<sup><a href="#fn5"
  id="ref5">5</a></sup> and unloved. They might be seen as disposable,
  and unimportant, but if they are used badly, a film seems staged and
  artificial. When used well, they add to the action and pacing and
  sometimes the humour of a movie. So let's have a closer look at these
humble, unnamed characters.

	 
# Mooks

{{% blockquote author="Terry Pratchett, Guards! Guards! " %}} 
 They may be called the
 Palace Guard, the City Guard, or the Patrol. Whatever the name, their
 purpose in any work of heroic fantasy is identical: it is, round
 about Chapter Three (or ten minutes into the film) to rush into the
 room, attack the hero one at a time, and be slaughtered. No one ever
 asks them if they wanted to.  
{{% /blockquote %}}

I can't keep calling them 'unnamed characters', so I'm going to call
them **mooks**.  You could call them *minions* or *extras* or *small fry* or
*drones* or *pawns* or *grunts* or *lackeys* or *cannon fodder* or *flunkies*, but
all of those terms are loaded with meaning, and as Lewis Carroll's egg said, I
want a word to mean what I choose it to mean. It's easier to enforce
that when the word isn't too heavily invested with other
meanings<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>.  The simple
definition of mook paraphrased in many places is
"[a stupid or incompetant person](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mook)",
but that dates back to the 30s in the US and isn't common anymore. I
won't be using that meaning. 
 
<!-- https://www.bartleby.com/73/2019.html -->

I like the way the RPG *Feng Shui* uses the word:

>  A less powerful enemy, easily dealt with, often appearing
>  in large groups to present some challenge. 
  
This usage does seem to be seeping into descriptions of the superhero
genre: e.g., some quick quotes:

+ [A slang term for the hordes of standard-issue, disposable bad guys whom The Hero mows down with impunity. ](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks)

+ [The *Winter Soldier* pits Cap against a dozen SHIELD/HYDRA mooks with stun clubs](https://www.quora.com/Relatively-speaking-which-MCU-movie-is-the-most-realistic)

+ [A standard Asgardian Mook](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/forums/battles-7/amazons-dceu-vs-asgardians-mcu-1879912/)

+ [One mook (Eric Oram) does confess to Stark that, “Honestly, I hate working here. They are so weird.” ](https://birthmoviesdeath.com/2019/04/25/iron-man-three-and-everyday-life-in-the-mcu)

So let's be precise here. My definition is

> **mook** (noun) /mu:k/ A disposable character (or sometimes an object), often
> appearing in groups, usually unnamed (not given a proper name),
> included in some form of conflict to illustrate main characters'
> abilities or intent or emotions, or just to increase the amount of
> action.

I am not using "mook" in a derogatory sense here. I am deliberately
not saying "less powerful". Some mooks are powerful in their own way,
but this is usually limited or narrow.  TV Tropes description is
["Deadly, competent, loyal, abundant... pick any two."](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks)

The point is, they aren't always cut down like chaff (though we will
see that they usually are). 

And they don't have to be "minions" in the sense they can be
independent of a villain's control. They can be part of their own
organisation, or independent.

I also do not automatically assume mooks are bad guys. The role
such characters play is often the same whether they are opposing
heroes or villains. The
[Red Shirts](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt) of
*Star Trek* are mooks by my definition. And sometimes mooks were
coerced, or mind-controlled, or they can be converted to the cause. So
good/evil distinctions aren't a necessary starting point, but we'll see
that most mooks are effectively evil when we look at the data.
 
They don't even have to be a person, as such. In many action movies,
objects take on many of the roles of a human either through explicit
anthropomorphism (Doctor Strange's Cloak of Levitation), or indirectly
as a [Mcguffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin) or other plot
device. And such objects can often have at least as much character and
verve as any other extra. In conflict, often an air or space craft is
an important adversary -- the interaction is dominated by the
characteristics of the craft involved -- and we might not even see the
pilot. So we can think of these as a type of object-mook.
   
The goal of this definition is not just to specify exactly what I
mean, but also to make it possible to automate some of the process of
analysis. I want to do a few simple things, like work out how often
mooks play a role in a movie, and having a relatively broad definition
is helpful. But I did have to do some work to collect the data, so
I'll describe that next, along with some results.    
   
# The data

If the topic is conflict, then we can't simply dissect the dialogue of a
movie as is commonly done in narrative analysis. Instead I watched the
whole MCU again. That wasn't too painful -- I really like the movies
(you may have guessed) -- but I also annotated every conflict, and who
was involved (a named character or mook). I could talk a lot about the
annotation process, but you'd probably get bored, so I will perhaps
leave that for another time.

One or two words are needed though. Here we define a *named character*
as one who has a proper noun as their name, i.e., Tony Stark. Everyone
else is unnamed, even "Tony Stark's secretary," but certainly "SHIELD
agent" isn't a name, it's a designation. The unnamed characters form
our pool of mooks, but only become relevant if they are involved in
(non-trivial) conflict.

The classification into names characters is facilitated by a couple of
big files (see https://github.com/mroughan/AlephZeroHeroesData/tree/master/MarvelCinematicUniverse)
of character names, primarily built by hand using credit lists from
IMDb, and various other source material.  

A "conflict" is a rubbery concept. Roughly it is an indivisible set of
actions between opposing characters, usually in the form of a physical
fight. Here we try to break fight scenes down as much as possible, so
conflicts are fairly short, but that can range from sub-second, to a
few seconds. So a character's contribution to the movie isn't purely a
function of the number of conflicts, but that's what I can count.

<!-- The unnamed characters includes -->

</div>
 
The overall picture is shown in the pie chart. Overall about 40% of
conflicts involve mooks.  That gives us grounds to say that mooks are
a critical part of modern action/superhero movies. So let's find out a
bit more about these surprisingly important MCU mooks.

The following table (click on the table to see the data directly)
lists mook participation by movie. It only covers the movies up to
*Captain Marvel* because I haven't had a chance to process *End
Game*. The table lists the movies and the percentages of conflict by
who was involved. The results are also illustrated in the bar chart
below.

<div class="ui large right floated image">
{{% csv_table src="/static/csv/mook_groups_char_v_mook.csv" link="https://github.com/mroughan/AlephZeroHeroesData/blob/master/MarvelCinematicUniverse/mook_groups_char_v_mook.csv" colStyle="text-align:right;" %}} 
</div>

<div class="ui floated image">
  <img src="/img/mook_groups_char_v_mook.png"> 
</div>
 
The really interesting feature of this data is how much variation
there is. We have less than 18% of conflicts in *Infinity War* that
involve mooks and *Civil War* is similar. Almost all of the action is
the main characters. That isn't surprising: both movies are team ups
of large groups of well-known characters (in the main), and so (i)
characters don't have to establish their bona fides by beating up a
bunch of no names, and (ii) there are plenty of opportunities for main
characters to beat up other main characters.

On the other hand we have movies like *Captain America* where nearly
70% of conflicts involve mooks.
 
And we see everything in between these two extremes. We see a small
cluster with total mook participation of 47-48% (from *The Incredible
Hulk* to *Iron Man*), but otherwise there seem to be a continuous range
of values. 

 
## What mook is that?
  
Most mooks belong to a group. Some are direct minions of a villain,
but often they are only employees (mercenaries being a common
example). Other times they are from a semi-independent organisation,
which is bigger than any one villain (e.g., Hydra).

Going through the movies, I classified the mooks by the group they
belonged to<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>.  The groups are
shown in part in the following table (click on the table to get a link
to the full list). The table also shows the cumulative percentage so
we can see that the top-10 mook groups account for nearly 50% of all
mook participation.
  
<div class="ui large right floated image">
  <img src="/img/mook_groups_category.png">
</div>

<div>
{{% csv_table src="/static/csv/mook_groups_groups.csv" link="https://github.com/mroughan/AlephZeroHeroesData/blob/master/MarvelCinematicUniverse/mook_groups_groups.csv" maxLines="10" colStyle="text-align:right;" %}} 
</div>

I don't think there are any big surprises there. Hydra is the secret
(evil) organisation that provides the backdrop for many of the movies
(opposed and interwoven with SHIELD), and supplies many of the
henchmen and minions. Ultron has a hoard of robot minions, and the
Chitauri are the bad guys in the epic "Battle for New York" in *The
Avengers*. Soldiers and Guards, Police and Criminals also feature
heavily. If you follow the link you will see many other types, most of
which come from more specific groups of movies and who consequently
appear less often. 

If we want to understand these groups, we need a coarser grouping, a
version of which I have shown in the pie chart. Here I used
[this table](https://github.com/mroughan/AlephZeroHeroesData/blob/master/MarvelCinematicUniverse/mook_groups.csv)
to put mook groups into categories roughly according to their fighting
prowess. The *Random* mooks are mostly civilians; the *Soldiers*
include other armed and trained groups such as police; the *Elites*
are elite soldiers (SHIELD and Hydra for instance); and the *Super*
category includes mooks that are superpowered beings in their own
right, for instance, the Extremis-fired mooks of *Iron Man 3*.

The other way to break the mooks down in terms of power, is to look at
how they are used as individuals. My categorisation is:

<div class="ui large right floated image">
  <img src="/img/mook_groups_subcat.png">
</div>
 
+ *Grunt mooks* -- these are your plain vanilla disposable mooks.

+ *Tank mooks* -- these aren't literal tanks. Drawing on terminology
from computer games, they are the *big-bruisers*, a cut-above the
average mook. Often a big guy, sometimes a guy wearing powered armour
or the like. The feature that distinguishes a tank from the
vanilla mooks is that they stand up and fight a superhero for more
than an instant.

+ *Mounted mooks* -- these are mooks who are riding an animal, or more
commonly piloting an aircraft or spacecraft, usually armed and
armoured, often flying but definitely more mobile than the average
mook. Think of them as the cavalry.

+ *Dragon mooks* -- these are really big, and really cranky; they are
named such because sometimes they are a literal dragon, or dragon-like
monster, but other times a big well-armed spaceship.

Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of mooks are "vanilla" mooks. Tanks,
for instance, are only used as particular obstacles in a heroes
narrative, and thus contribute only a small percentage of
instances. Likewise Mounted and Dragon mooks, who play a similar role,
and have a similar scarcity. The vast majority of mooks are, in fact,
chaff.


## Good v Evil(ish)

The movie is not about the mooks. It not called "Captain Mook" or "The
Incredible Mook." It's about the heroes and villains. The mooks are
supporting acts, so we expect that mooks will fight villains and
heroes. Mostly that is true, as we saw above. With the exception of 

+ *Captain America: The First Avenger*
+ *Thor: The Dark World*
+ *Iron Man*
+ *Iron Man 3*

the vast majority of mook conflicts are against named characters. And
these movies all have large-scale battles involving mooks on both
sides. 

<div class="ui large right floated image">
  <img src="/img/mook_groups_alignment.png">
</div> 

But what type of characters do the mooks fight? We could analyse them
in a few ways, but the most interesting seems to be whether mooks
primarily oppose the heroes or the villains. The characters were
classified (again manually -- see [this file](https://github.com/mroughan/AlephZeroHeroesData/blob/master/MarvelCinematicUniverse/alignment.csv)) into Good/Bad, but there are some
difficult cases: a small number that don't have a known allegiance and
a slightly larger group whose allegiance is, let us say,
flexible. Either they oscillate (e.g. Loki) or follow a redemption
path (e.g. the Scarlet Witch) -- we lump these cases into "It's
Complicated". 

Nearly three quarters of mook conflicts involve a named
protagonist. That highlights their roles in (i) showing the heroes
superpower, and (ii) increasing the level of action. 

Much more rarely a mook opposes a "complicated" hero and even more
rarely a villain. The MCU doesn't seem to use mooks as wholesale
fodder for villains to wipe out (Ragnarok is an exception) so much as
obstacles for the heroes before they get to the big bads. And even the
major group of "good" mooks turns out to be evil (spoiler: SHIELD is
really Hydra). 


# Conclusion

{{% blockquote author="GURPS For Dummies" %}} 
 Without his Storm Troopers (or his Clones) the Emperor of the Star
Wars universe would have been nothing more then a personal menace with
a great need for a plastic surgeon and a better fashion
consultant. And where would Sauron have been without his Orcs. The
power of most Masterminds lies with their minions—the faceless hordes
who exist to do (literally) only the Mastermind's bidding and work
their evil upon the game world.
{{% /blockquote %}}

Mooks make the world go round. Not literally. There isn't a secret
cabal of millions of mooks running in giant equatorial circles to spin
up the globe. (But wouldn't that be cool!)

Mooks make action movies move. They provide colour and background and
context and pace. In extreme cases, up to 60-70% of action in a movie
involves mooks. So they can't be discounted as an unimportant part of
the movie industry. And their role and importance shouldn't be based
on whether they speak or not. At the very least it would make my life
easier if they were given more formal credit (it would save me a lot
of manual data entry).

In other ways the findings here aren't surprising at all. But they
highlight the nature of heroes as compared to villains in our
narratives. Heroes tend to be independent and self-sufficient. They
aren't managers (or if they are -- Tony Stark -- they aren't very good
managers). Our idea of a hero is someone who makes their own way in
the world. They achieve through their own drive, knowledge, bravery,
force of character and ability.

Villains, on the other hand, we associate with bosses: people who
control and dominate others. Villains *use* others for their evil
schemes. Villains corrupt others to their purposes. 

These are tropes that go way beyond the MCU, superhero movies, or
movies in general. We can see them in cowboy movies, in fairy tales,
in mythology, and in a large part of Western literature. Probably they
appear outside the West as well, but I'm not in a position to say for
sure. 

For me, understanding mooks in the MCU has led to a better understanding
of our (Western) values, in particular how they are expressed in the
narratives that we use to build our ideas of morality. We don't tell
heroic stories (at least not often) about brave industrialists whose
tireless work participating in board meetings led to the construction
of temple-like factories, and whose personal ambition was tempered by
their desire to do good<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>. Those stories are generally dark satirical
comedies. We tell stories about the brave individuals who save kittens
(and other innocents) from said industrialists and their evil
corporations. That reflects how we think about those roles in our
society. And that ties into one of the underlying themes of the blog -- to
understand how superhero stories reflect and affect our society.

# Available Data

Just a quick note to remind you that most of the data used here is
available at
https://github.com/mroughan/AlephZeroHeroesData/tree/master/MarvelCinematicUniverse. GitHub
