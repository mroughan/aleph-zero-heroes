# Intro 

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is the language of choice for
statisticians these days. The reasons for that are historical in part,
but ultimately derive from the community around R.

[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is an up-and-coming new language. In
my view it has some advantages over R.

But R is number 7 in the
[2018 IEEE Top Programming Languages](https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/the-2018-top-programming-languages),
and Julia is a lowly 32 below a few things I've not even heard of. And
it only get's rated for enterprise apps, not embedded or web apps. 

So can Julia take on a giant? I think the answer is yes, but it takes
a lot to swing a community over to a new language. One of Julia's
advantages is it can play at being other languages pretty well. The
topic of this blog is can it do some of the core R tasks in a way that
is easy for a statistician to get going, and worth doing from the
point of view of performance (Julia's main selling point).  

# GLM

The strength of a language these days is not its core, it's the
packages that go with it (and the community that build the
packages). That's the secret of Python's success IMHO.

So let's try a Julia package that promises to provide functionality
that I would normally go to R to get: fitting a Generalized Linear
Model. 

what is this

how do we do it

# The tests


(1) Julia looks like R: input and output


(2) Julia has the same features as R ???


(3) Performance: big data set 




# Summary
      
Personally, I think the writing is on the wall for R. In the rankings
it has dropped from its peak at No.5 in 2016, and No.6 in 2017. I
can't see any reason its going to start back up that slope, but I have
been wrong before.

But Julia is going up either (it dropped from No.30). Competition
between languages is fierce. But there's some room, and Julia should
get a bump this year because of the release (late 2018) of a much
awaited v1.0.
	  
Let's see how they go.
