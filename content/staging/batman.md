<!-- A hero can be anyone, even a man doing something as simple and -->
<!-- reassuring as putting a coat on a young boy’s shoulders to let him -->
<!-- know the world hadn’t ended. -->

<!-- I wear a mask. And that mask, it's not to hide who I am, but to create what I am. -->

<!-- “If I have to have a past, then I prefer it to be multiple choice.” -->
<!-- ― Alan Moore, Batman: The Killing Joke  -->

<!-- “You don't get heaven or hell. Do you know the only reward you get for being Batman? You get to be Batman.” -->
<!-- ― Neil Gaiman, Batman: Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader?  -->

<!-- “Alfred: Hmf. I suppose you'll take up flying next, like that fellow in Metropolis.” -->
<!-- ― Frank Miller, Batman: Year One  -->

<!-- “He's clearly a man with a mission, but it's not one of vengeance. Bruce is not after personal revenge ... He's much bigger than that; he's much more noble than that. He wants the world to be a better place, where a young Bruce Wayne would not be a victim ... In a way, he's out to make himself unnecessary. Batman is a hero who wishes he didn't have to exist.” -->
<!-- ― Frank Miller, Batman: Year One  -->
