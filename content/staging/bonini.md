Bonini's paradox, data-science and superheroes

# Superheroes

Superheroes are a redaction
(footnote: redaction in its simplistic meaning, i.e., of running a black marker
over a text is rather ...) 
of reality. 

Ignore physically impossible super-powers for a moment. We can see
most (even the impossible) powers as 

science of superheroes ... 



They are surreal in the sense
that 


They are a map
