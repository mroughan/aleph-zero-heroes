A little while back I came across
[Hilary White's blog post](https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Buffy-Vampire-Slayer-Infographics-44630999)
on a new book [*Slayer Stats: The Complete Inforgraphic Guide to All
Things Buffy*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34536544-buffy-the-vampire-slayer). It's
a terrific reminder of how great *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* was. 

Quick refresh: Buffy had

+ 6 seasons on TV from 1996-2003 
+ 1 (non-canon) movie, (1992) 
+ One spin off TV series: Angel (5 seasons)
+ Many sets of comics: core Buffy comics, plus comics based many of the side characters
+ CDs of the soundtracks
+ A long [list of novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Buffyverse_novels)
+ 5 [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_video_games)
+ a [Buffy/Angel role-playing game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffyverse_role-playing_games)
+ a [collectable card game](http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=2663) 
+ It's own [fandom](https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer)



Looking at all this, I realise I am not as good a fan of Buffy as I
thought I was. I haven't read most of the books, played any of the
games, and just maybe half the comics (if I'm lucky).  And there is
talk of a new series.

It's enough that we can easily talk about the *Buffyverse*. And there
is a [canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffyverse_canon) of core
material. So I am happy to include it in my list of large-scale hybrid
media. 

Buffy is, I think, important as well not just because of it's success,
but also because it broke a few moulds, most notably it had a heroic
female lead character. There was no doubt that she (and other slayers)
were the superheroes of this world, and the others (watchers, soulful
vampires, witches, and so on) were her side-kicks. That's in contrast
to the
[most of the rest of the superhero world](https://pudding.cool/2017/07/comics/?ex_cid=SigDig).  

It was also a pioneer in including a serious same-sex relationship in
a mainstream TV series. 

It had enough depth that *Buffyology* became a serious area of
[academic scholarship](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/10/the-rise-of-buffy-studies/407020/): with

+ a journal
  [Slayage: The Journal of Whedon Studies](https://www.whedonstudies.tv/slayage-the-journal-of-whedon-studies.html)
  and associated
  [conference](https://www.whedonstudies.tv/conference.html).
+ scholarly books, e.g., [Fighting the Forces: What's at Stake in Buffy the Vampire Slayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_the_Forces)
+ university courses in media and gender studies. 

In fact [these guys](https://slate.com/culture/2012/06/pop-culture-studies-why-do-academics-study-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-more-than-the-wire-the-matrix-alien-and-the-simpsons.html)
found that Buffy was (easily) the most studied pop-cultural icon. 

I think a lot of the series depth is owed to Joss Whedon, its
creator. He's also been involved with some critical movies in the MCU,
and a lot of other amazing works. 

The book
[*Slayer Stats: The Complete Infographic Guide to All Things Buffy*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34536544-buffy-the-vampire-slayer)
is cute. It's mostly cartoony infographics that are aimed at fans, not
serious analysis. But I really like the network picture featured
above. AT some point I am going to have to get or make a dataset like
this, but we're not going to do a network analysis this time around.

### Multi-scale, self-similarity

So what could I possibly add to this preponderance of literature?
Well, once again, the vast majority of works on the *Buffyverse* are
not mathematical, so I think we can add something here. 


Joss master of the
+ monster of the week
+ the season long plot -- the "big bad"
+ the hints and easter eggs hinting at a longer plot, almost as long as the series

It became a common idea around then
+ X files
+ Friends

Almost forgotton now, it sometimes seems, with the long plot taking
over so much that a season can seem like an very-long extended movie.

### Can we model it???

data

words and information theory ....


break scripts into intervals, and compress each interval. Look at the
overall compression ration as a function of interval width

	-- maybe Buffy is different from say Seinfeld? 
	

### Scripts to the TV series?
