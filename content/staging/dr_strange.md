The comic *Doctor Strange* was somewhat unique. Instead of
super-powers the eponymous Doctor has magic.

Back in the day, it was also well know for a somewhat more exploratory
art style than some others.

So we might think that the suposedly ubiquitous Golden ration and its
friend the Golden spiral would crop up there. Does they?

More generally, there are entire books written about the Golden ratio,
and how important it is both in nature and art. We won't be looking at
nature here, but we will examine the question of whether the ratio is
quite as prevalent as claimed.

The simple expedient we adopt here is to test the claim that
rectangles whose sides have lengths following the Golden ratio are
most appealling. If this were so, we might expect that comic-book
artists would often use such frames. Their notional appeal would make
them attrrative to the artist, and more commerically viable. So even
if they don't deliberately seek this ratio, it should crop up often.

Why look at Doctor Strange
