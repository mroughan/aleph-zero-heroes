10 things you can do to make your report more data-sciency

A crucial component of data-science is communicating results. There
are many components to good communication skills, so I will
concentrate here on the pieces that can make an ordinary report seem
more "sciency". 

The key concept is to make the work seem more complex. The last thing
you want is just anyone to read it. If someone of ordinary
intelligence were to understand your work they might ask stupid
questions. If someone who isn't willing to "put the work in" were to
read it, who knows what mischief that could cause. So we need to make
sure that our work is difficult, if not impossible to read. 

Moreover, we really don't want anyone to think our work is simple to
understand. That is the anathema of science. No-one will value it, if
it seems too easy. 

I have 10 suggestions that are commonly used by data- and other
scientists around the world

10. Never use a simple word when a complicated word will do. The more
    syllables the better. Unusual and obscure words are a must. A
    reader should be willing to carry a dictionary with them at all
    times. I suggest that, as an author, you use a thesaurus
    frequently, or better yet, write a program that will look up words
    and replace them randomly from said thesaurus, to avoid any
    limitations in your own understanding of said big words. 
	
9. Use awkward and confusing word orderings. Passive voice is a
   particular favourite. By placing the verb before the subject you
   force a reader to store more information in their active
   memory. Over time, this will force your readers to improve their
   short term memory, and what is communication about if not improving
   our readers? 
   
8. If one source is good, and 2 is better, then citing 10 or 20 must
   be wonderful. Be careful not to read source materials as if you do
   you might realise they are irrelevant or inappropriate to the
   argument at hand. Best to compile lists by concatenating other
   people's lists. 
   
7. Hide your reasoning behind long convoluted sentences. Long lists of
   items (examples, qualifying clauses, side-issues, what you had at
   lunch last Tuesday and so on and so on). Ideally, by the time
   someone gets to the end of the sentence they have forgotten the
   start. This will force them to repeat the reading the sentence,
   which avoids the need for us as authors to repeat key ideas.
   
6. Never use contractions! The use of "it's" or "don't" befouls a
   text. One contraction and your work will never be clean again!
   
5. Always spell out numbers as words. Nothing says amateur more
   clearly than writing 656,413 instead of six hundred and fifty six
   thousand, four hundred and thirteen. Ideally this would be extended
   to tables of numbers as well, but unfortunately, common usage has
   brought us to a state of affairs where tables often use digital
   representation instead of words. 
   
4. Many of the above rules are spelled out in detail, but fall into a
   larger category of stylistic rules. These rules are rules, by
   damn. Never, ever break a rule. Not even once! Not even to
   emphasise a piece of text, or achieve clarity. 

3. Collaborative writing is an important component of our
   skill-set. In writing with others it is important to impress these
   others with your skill and knowledge of writing. Pick a particular
   rule (for instance the Oxford comma or "comprised of") and correct
   everything they write. Do it assiduously, and make sure to point
   out each instance you have to correct. You co-writers will
   appreciate your efforts to improve them.

2. It is difficult to sound like a modern scientist unless you use
   acronyms fluently. It will make you look like a newbie if you need
   to define these, so omit all definitions. If you define your own
   new acronyms, then you may be forced to define them, but it is best
   to sprinkle such definitions randomly through a text so as not to
   overload a reader near the start. In data science we sometimes need
   to write mathematics. Use of mathematical notation is much like use
   of acronyms. Defining terms will make it seem like you don't know
   them yourself, or that you are patronising your reader, so again,
   omit all definitions. If you must include definitions it is best to
   hide them somewhere well away from where they are used. As a minor
   addition tweak, it is sometimes useful to reuse the same symbol to
   mean two or more different things. This can reduce the number of
   symbols a reader must memorise and help them greatly.
   
1. It is vitally important that your writing never come to a concrete
   conclusion. A definite conclusion might allow others to question
   your ideas. Omit axis labels and legends from graphs, and for
   goodness sake never interpret said graphs or provide captions
   detailed enough for someone to interpret themselves. Prefer vague
   words over definite specific or quantitative words. And if you
   absolutely feel you must provide some sort of summative commentary
   on your work, make sure to bury it deep inside a large body of
   turgid text that no-one can possibly read.

Follow these 10 rules and I guarantee you will be writing like a
scientist in no time at all.
