is there a sci-fi ghetto for actors?

	e.g., once you have had a starting role in sci-fi how common is it
	to just bounce between scifi and other
		- IMDB has genre
		    sci-fi includes fantasy, horror, anime (voice), superhero,
		       ???
			
			
    conditional probability of genre of other roles after successful
    sci-fi leading role...
		- label a set of successful sci fi
		     say 3 seasons
	    - lead actors are ????
			 say actors that appear in 50% of episodes of a season???
   
    then trace the IMDB careers of each of these
	
consider 1st succcessful appearnce vs later?
	survivor analysis for actors that don't have later careers???
	
	
consider how many actors have at least 2 TV series they are lead in???


so not "lead" actor so much as recurring/important/??? character?

+++++

  + just add firefly in as well!!!
