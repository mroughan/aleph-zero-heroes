What good is a blog if you can't go off topic sometimes? I guess
that's what I'm doing today.

Who invented the Calculus? Depending on your predelections, you will
probably say either Newton or Leibnitz. If you did, you're wrong.

Newton said he stood on the shoulders of giants. Isaac Barrow is one
of the giants.
