"New forms of art are created by the canonization of peripheral forms",
-- Viktor Shklovsky


Susan Sontag quote this in reference to photography.



Many people paint recreationally. Photography is praticed by almost
everyone with a phone. Music is taught to every second
grade-schooler. And almost everyone I ever knew was forced to write,
creatively (perhaps).

We have, in the West (and elsewhere) digested the idea that Art is not
just teh pursuit of the gifted and driven. It is part of every persons
cultural and social kit bag.

But who draws comics? The marginalised "geeks" of our world. Why is that?

Comics are still perhipheral art. Still considered by most to be
infantile hybrids of other forms. Still considered unworthy of serious
study.

That was the state of photography for many years. It's status as an
art was only just being recognised when the explosion of digital
photography killed ... 

Movies likewise, for many years, were not considered true
art. Directors were diletants and crazies. 1


Technology is a key driver of art. New art forms arise from new
technological possibilities, and are despised by artists in existing
forms.












Neil Gaiman and his collaborators have produced some of the most purely creative work.

Creativity is hard.

Brian Eno

Creativity lives at the *edge of chaos*

No I don't mean Gaiman's hair.
