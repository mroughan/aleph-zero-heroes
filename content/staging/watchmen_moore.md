### *Quis custodiet ipsos custodes*

If you don't know why I selected a Rorschach inkblot test as the
featured art for today, you **need** to read Alan Moore's *Watchmen*.

*Watchmen* redefined comics for me.

It took something I liked, and showed me it could be important as
well, all the time viciously satirising its own genre. And rebuilding
that genre into something better. 

And it counts in the space I care about: there is a movie, and on-line
... It's not as big as the MCU but in many ways the comic was just as
important. I don't think modern graphic novel authors would have dug
as deep without *Watchmen* watching over their shoulders.

So I have to work on this "comic" at least once as part of this blog.

### On Comics

Maybe we should start this with a more serious discussion of graphic novels.

Turns out it isn't that easy a medium to define.

It's been used as an experiemental medium for marginalised authors and
artists for so long that almost anything and everything has been
done. And yet, there is lots of art that isn't a graphic novel or a
comic. They range from the trivial (I never liked Charlie Brown much)
to the humerous (I like Larson and Dilbert) to the pulp comics that
made superheroes famous (Action Comics #1), to the French new wave
which feature simply stunning art, to "children's books" (I grew up
with Asterix and Tin Tin, I love the former, and am more ambivalent
about the latter), to Japanese Manga, to what is IMHO serious
literature, for instance, the subject of this very post.

And the quality of art ranges from simple line drawings (I love the
minimalism of XKCD), to very serious art (I can spend a day looking at
many covers, and the inside of some of the *Sandman* comics is
glorious). And there are very few places where artists have
collaborated in such large numbers, or sos consistently on visions of
the same underlying (fictional) people, places and themes. How many
images of Gotham are there in a world that doesn't actually have a
Gotham?

Some comics are a single frame. Others a triptic. Others a book. And
others an entire series.

Scott McCloud's definition is

> **com-ics n.** plural in form, used with a singular verb. **1.**
>    Juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence,
>    intended to convey information and/or to produce an aesthetic
>    reponse in the viewer.

But defers to Eisener's "Sequential art" for every-day use. But I like
McCloud's definition, and his resoning.

Comics use space in the same way movies use time. They juxtapose
sequences of images in space, rather than flash them on a screen over
time. That's an important difference. Images flashed on a screen blru
together, and engage our eyes and brains mechnisms to turn that
directly into a movie. Images in space require our deeper thought
processes to turn them into meaning.


And the use of space is my topic for today.

### Watchmen

So Moore steps into this history with *Watchmen* not his first, or
last contribution. Arguably his best.

...


Originally, most people (at least today) access it in the compiled form ... 


### Data, give me bricks 

So what can we say, quantitatively about the book? 


### Symetry

So ... does *Watchmen* have any maths behind it?

Undoubtedly! But what.

Instead of trying to analyse it, which has been done ad nauseum, I
thought I would just focus on the picture at the start --- the first
Rorschach inkblot test<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>.

One of the key characters in *Watchmen* is called Rorschach (we only
learn late in the piece his real name). He starts as an idealistic
vigilante using a high-tech face mask that dynamically displays images
similar to Rorschach tests<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup.

All I want to do today is look at why this is such a compelling type
of image. An class of image that is somehow random, and yet not
completely. That is so compelling that it soaked out of psychology
into mainstream thought as an emblem of that science. And it is
somehow hypnotic as a mask for a character. Moore's use of this to
replace a face is disturbing, but we quickly become used to it. How is
that possible?

I think the underlying truth is that we seek symmetry. But not too
much symmetry.


PATTERN FORMATION


Symmetry is a critical piece of the graphic novel, and maybe that is
what Moore recognised. The construction of a page uses panels. ...

But it is rare today to see perfect symmetry

how we break symmetry is almost more interesting than how we use it. 


### Hybrid forms of *Watchmen*

I am interested in the overlap in media (in this blog). *Watchmen* did
that. There is a movie. Apparently Alan Moore disliked it enough to
distance himself from the movie. He isn't even credited.

As far as I can tell Alan Moore hasn't like anything done with his
work (V for Vendetta was also made into a movie, and ...)

So what an you say when the pieces of the puzzle diverge like that?
When the author distances themselves, and considers the

I guess we should think of art like our children. We bring them into
the world, but they are not our possessions (whatever intellectual
property laws say). Eventually, they become something beyond what we
intended. This is a good thing, though many people rail against it.



Vitruvian man ...

     When we meet Rorschach, he is dissillusioned to the point of
     psychosis, and ultra-violent as a result. But he is still a
     sympathetic character, and you might consider him to be the
     protagonist of the story, though Moore is *very* good at bluring
     the lines between protagnoist and antagonist. It's one of the
     aspects of *Watchmen* that makes it so much deeper than many of
     its contemperay comics.
