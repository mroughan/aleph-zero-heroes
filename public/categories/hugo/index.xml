      <description>Literate Programming and Live Documents I think one of the ideas that will have the largest, long-term impact of science in general, and data-science in particular is the extension of literate programming to live documents.
Literate programming is a radical idea put forward by Knuth that computer program shouldn&amp;rsquo;t just be commented. They should be a readable document that contains code.
That doesn&amp;rsquo;t initially sound radical, but it is. Programmers still, despite decades of education, usually document code as an afterthought.</description>
