      <description>Intro I mentioned in my last post on Julia that dictionaries are incredibly useful data structures for data science. I thought that warranted a little more discussion. And it leads to another data structure that we use a lot: Data Frames. They&amp;rsquo;re the topic for today.
Dictionaries A dictionary (in computer programming) is much like an English dictionary. It takes a set of objects (the keys) and maps them to something else (the values).</description>

      <description>Julia for Data Science Data science has a major component that is computational. You can&amp;rsquo;t do very much with just a pen and paper. Luckily there are some great programming languages available. The best known these days is Python I guess, with R a close runner up (it&amp;rsquo;s a favourite of the stats community). There are a dozen others.
The up-and-coming new kid on the block is Julia. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t have as much history.</description>
