      <description>I talked about the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and why it&amp;rsquo;s interesting in a previous post. Have a read if you want to get started on this. Today I want to talk about a way of visualising the relationships between the characters and the movies in a timeline (shown above).
And as a minor note, I just saw Captain Marvel, which is brilliant, but required a few last minute alterations to the timeline.</description>

      <description>Intro This is a blog about data science and superheroes. I think there is some serious data science hidden in the pages of comics, and that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re here to discuss.
I also think math and stats are the under-represented underpinnings of good data science. Drew Conway&amp;rsquo;s data-science Venn diagram expresses that best I think.
  Hacking and domain knowledge without mathematics is Drew&amp;rsquo;s Danger Zone.
I&amp;rsquo;ve read and watched superhero comics and movies for years, so I have just a little domain expertise.</description>
