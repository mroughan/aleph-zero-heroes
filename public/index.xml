      <description>I talked about the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and why it&amp;rsquo;s interesting in a previous post. Have a read if you want to get started on this. Today I want to talk about a way of visualising the relationships between the characters and the movies in a timeline (shown above).
Visualising the MCU How do we visualise something as complex as the MCU? Well, there are a few other folks who&amp;rsquo;ve had a go:</description>

      <description>Julia for Data Science Data science has a major component that is computational. You can&amp;rsquo;t do very much with just a pen and paper. Luckily there are some great programming languages available. The best known these days is Python I guess, with R a close runner up (it&amp;rsquo;s a favourite of the stats community). There are a dozen others.
The up-and-coming new kid on the block is Julia. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t have as much history.</description>

      <title>The Coolness of the MCU</title>

      <description>Intro This is a blog about data science and superheroes. I think there is some serious data science hidden in the pages of comics, and that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re here to discuss.
I also think math and stats are the under-represented underpinnings of good data science. Drew Conway&amp;rsquo;s data-science Venn diagram expresses that best I think.
  Hacking and domain knowledge without mathematics is Drew&amp;rsquo;s Danger Zone.
I&amp;rsquo;ve read and watched superhero comics and movies for years, so I have just a little domain expertise.</description>

      <description>Aleph-Zero-Heroes The title of the blog comes from a, perhaps obscure, piece of mathematics. Mathematically speaking aleph zero &amp;ndash; which we write \(\displaystyle \aleph_0\) &amp;ndash; is the cardinality of the set of natural numbers, which is a pretty mathsy way of saying &amp;ldquo;infinity&amp;rdquo;. So the name, aleph-zero-heroes, loosely translates as infinite heroes.
I don&amp;rsquo;t just care about superheroes &amp;ndash; more broadly they are a archetype that comes up frequently in the context of hybrid narratives, and that is what I want to tap into.</description>
