      <description>Aleph-Zero-Heroes The title of the blog comes from a, perhaps obscure, piece of mathematics. Mathematically speaking aleph zero &amp;ndash; which we write \(\displaystyle \aleph_0\) &amp;ndash; is the cardinality of the set of natural numbers, which is a pretty mathsy way of saying &amp;ldquo;infinity&amp;rdquo;. So the name, aleph-zero-heroes, loosely translates as infinite heroes.
I don&amp;rsquo;t just care about superheroes &amp;ndash; more broadly they are a archetype that comes up frequently in the context of hybrid narratives, and that is what I want to tap into.</description>
