      <description>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes If you don&amp;rsquo;t know why I selected a Rorschach inkblot test as the featured art for today, you need to read Alan Moore&amp;rsquo;s Watchmen.
Watchmen redefined comics for me.
It took something I liked, and showed me it could be important as well, all the time viciously satirising its own genre. And rebuilding that genre into something better.
And it counts in the space I care about: there is a movie, and on-line &amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s not as big as the MCU but in many ways the comic was just as important.</description>
