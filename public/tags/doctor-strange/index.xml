      <description>The comic Doctor Strange was somewhat unique. Instead of super-powers the eponymous Doctor has magic.
Back in the day, it was also well know for a somewhat more exploratory art style than some others.
So we might think that the suposedly ubiquitous Golden ration and its friend the Golden spiral would crop up there. Does they?
More generally, there are entire books written about the Golden ratio, and how important it is both in nature and art.</description>
