      <description>I talked about the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and why it&amp;rsquo;s interesting in a previous post. Have a read if you want to get started on this. Today I want to talk about a way of visualising the relationships between the characters and the movies in a timeline (shown above).
And as a minor note, I just saw Captain Marvel, which is brilliant, but required a few last minute alterations to the timeline.</description>
